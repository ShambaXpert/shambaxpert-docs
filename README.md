# AI-Powered Tomato Disease Detection App

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Tomato farming plays a crucial role in Kenyaâ€™s agricultural sector, contributing significantly to food security and economic growth. However, tomato farmers face substantial losses due to diseases that often go undetected until itâ€™s too late. Our AI-powered mobile application provides a solution by enabling early disease detection through image analysis, helping farmers make informed decisions to protect their crops.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **AI-Powered Image Analysis**: Farmers can upload images of infected tomato plants to receive instant disease diagnosis.
- **Accurate Treatment Recommendations**: Provides scientifically-backed organic and chemical treatment options.
- **User-Friendly Mobile Interface**: Designed for easy navigation, even on low-end smartphones.
